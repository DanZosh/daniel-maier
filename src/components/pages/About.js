      <p>
      After 10 years in the construction industry I'm looking to make a change and take on a new challenge. I'm learning how to code because I realized that my favorite part of my job was creating spreadsheet tools to aid in mechanical design that I shared with my colleagues. I find creating, testing and perfecting the tools, to be very satisfying. I hope to create more as a software developer in the future..
